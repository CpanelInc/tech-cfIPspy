./cfIPspy <domainname.tld>

Example: 

./cfIPspy xxxxxxx.tld
You entered a hostname of xxxxxxxx.tld which resolves to a CloudFlare IP address!
	\_ 104.21.45.240
Checking some common subdomains to see if we can obtain a non-CloudFlare IP address (IE: the real server IP)...
Checking SPF record for immute.io to see if it contains an IP Address
	\_ The IP address found within the spf record for xxxxxxxx.tld.io is: 38.xxx.254.xx

./cfIPspy yyyyyyyyyy.tld
You entered a hostname of yyyyyyyyyyy.tld  which resolves to: xx.242.xxx.x8 and does NOT belong to CloudFlare.

./cfIPspy 99.999.999.99
Please enter a domain name or hostname and not an IP address.

./cfIPspy sxxxxxxx.com
cfIPspy Version: 1.0
You entered a hostname of sxxxxxxxx.com which resolves to a CloudFlare IP address!
	\_ 104.20.94.138
Checking some common subdomains to see if we can obtain a non-CloudFlare IP address (IE: the real server IP)...
	\_ mail.sxxxxxxxx.com has a non-CloudFlare IP address of mail.f.statcounter.com. [ No PTR ]
	\_ mail.sxxxxxxxx.com has a non-CloudFlare IP address of 91.208.19.200 [ mailerf1.us-tampa.statcounter.com. ]
	\_ ns1.sxxxxxxxx.com has a non-CloudFlare IP address of 91.208.0.251 [ ns1.statcounter.com. ]
	\_ ns2.sxxxxxxxx.com has a non-CloudFlare IP address of 91.208.19.129 [ No PTR ]
Checking SPF record for sxxxxxxxx.com to see if it contains an IP Address
	\_ The IP address found within the spf record for sxxxxxxxx.com is: 4x.xx.xx.10x

Note: It does not always work.

You can add it to your .bashrc file as follows:

alias cfIPspy="/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/perl <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CpanelInc/tech-cfIPspy/master/cfIPspy) "

Then you can just type: 

cfIPspy domainname.tld
